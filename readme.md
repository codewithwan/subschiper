# Substitution Cipher Analyzer

This project is a simple web-based tool to analyze and decode substitution ciphers. It allows users to input a cipher text, analyze the frequency of each letter, and manually replace letters to decode the message.

## Features

- **Frequency Analysis**: Analyze the frequency of each letter in the cipher text.
- **Manual Replacement**: Replace letters manually to decode the cipher text.
- **Live Preview**: See the decoded text in real-time as you make replacements.
